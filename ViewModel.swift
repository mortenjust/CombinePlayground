    /// How's it different from a publisher? It's less flexible, like having something happening on new subscriptions, and we're `sink`ing on a `publisher` rather than on the class itself. The result is a `publisher` on a well-known class, resulting in the same interface as Apple has added to their pre-Combine era classesâ€”and also a few new ones.
